DReAMy is a python library to automatically analyse (for now only) textual dream reports. At the moment, annotations are exclusively based on the [Hall & Van de Castle](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4899-0298-6_2) emotions framework, but we are looking forward to expanding our set applications. As for the theoretical backbone, DReAMy and its model are based on a fruitful collaboration between NLP and sleep research. For more details, please refer to the [pre-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14828)

# Installation and usage
DReAMy can be easily installed via pip, and we do recommend using a virtual environment with python 3.9 installed. If you wish to play/query a set of DReAMy's model, you can do so using the [`DReAMv.1`](https://huggingface.co/spaces/DReAMy-lib/dream) ðŸ¤— Space.
```
pip install dreamy
```

# Current Features
At the moment, DReAMy has four main features: 
- Datasets, allowing to download and use of two dream-report datasets from DreamBank.
- Emotion Classification, allowing easily classify lists of reports for HVDC emotions.
- NER (or character annotation), allowing the extraction of relevant characters appearing in a given report. 
- Encodings: that easily collects and explores (contextualised) embeddings of textual reports.

Usage examples can be found in the code below, and in the tutorial folder. 

## Dataset
DReAMy has direct access to two datasets. A smaller English-only (~ 20k), with more descriptive variables (such as gender and year), and a larger and multilingual one (En/De, ~ 30k). You can easily choose which to download using the simple code below.

```py
import dreamy

language   = "english" # choose between english/multi
dream_bank = dreamy.get_HF_DreamBank(as_dataframe=True, language=language)

n_samples     = 10
dream_sample  = dream_bank.sample(n_samples, random_state=35).reset_index(drop=True)
dream_as_list = dream_sample["dreams"].tolist()

dream_bank.sample(2)
```

## Emotion Classification
DReAMy comes equipped with a set of models tuned to reproduce expert-annotators labels according to the [Hall & Van de Castle](https://dreams.ucsc.edu/Coding/) system. These models can perform emotion classification. (a.k.a. sentiment analysis) in two main formats: presence and generation.

### Presence 
Two models are currently available to detect the presence of different emotions: `base-en` and `large-multi`.
```py 
classification_type = "presence"
model_type          = "base-en"
return_type         = "distribution" # set "present" for above-threshold only
device              = "cpu"

predictions = dreamy.predict_emotions(
    dream_as_list, 
    classification_type, 
    model_type,
    return_type=return_type, 
    device=device,
)

predictions
```
```
[[{'label': 'CO', 'score': 0.7488341331481934},
  {'label': 'HA', 'score': 0.09567967802286148},
  {'label': 'AN', 'score': 0.03418444097042084},
  {'label': 'AP', 'score': 0.019197145476937294},
  {'label': 'SD', 'score': 0.012466167099773884}],
 [{'label': 'HA', 'score': 0.9818947911262512},
  {'label': 'SD', 'score': 0.03642113506793976},
  {'label': 'AP', 'score': 0.03470420092344284},
  {'label': 'CO', 'score': 0.024184534326195717},
  {'label': 'AN', 'score': 0.023663492873311043}]
```
You can get the HVDC decodings via 
```py
dreamy.Coding_emotions
```
```
{'AN': 'anger',
 'AP': 'apprehension',
 'SD': 'sadness',
 'CO': 'confusion',
 'HA': 'happiness'}
```
#### Generation
Under this format, a `T5-base` model is trained with the same data to generate emotion-based reports, with two extra features. First, the emotions are "numbered". This refers to the fact that if the same emotion was found more than once in the same report, the model should be able to identify so. Second, the model is also trained to recognise *to which character* the emotions are associated with. See the examples below.

##### English-only, characters + numbered emotions
```py 
classification_type = "generation"
model_type          = "char-en"
device              = "cpu"

predictions = dreamy.generate_emotions(
    dream_as_list, 
    classification_type, 
    model_type,
    device=device,
)

predictions
```
```
['The dreamer experienced apprehension.',
 'The group joint stranger adult experienced happiness. The dreamer experienced anger.',]
```
## NER
An important aspect of each dream report is the characters appearing in it. The code below allows you to easily extract characters in a given report, once again following the (spelt out) HVDC notation. Please note that CHAR data used in training is not linked to any specific HVDC feature (emotions, misfortune, etc...). In other words, given the same report, predictions can (or should) be different from the emotion-generation model.
```py 
classification_type = "full"
model_type          = "base-en"
device              = "cpu"

predictions = dreamy.get_CHAR(
    dream_as_list, 
    classification_type, 
    model_type,
    device=device,
    max_new_token=60,
)
predictions
```
```
['individual female known adult; group female uncertian adult; individual indefinite uncertian adult;',
 'individual female known adult;']
```

## Encoding, reduction and visualisation
You can also use DReAMy to easily extract, reduce, cluster, and visualise (contextualised) encodings (i.e., vector embeddings) of dream reports, with few and simple lines of code. At the moment, you can choose between four models, which are combinations of small/large English-only/multilingual models.

```py
import dreamy

# get some data
n_samples  = 10
language   = "english" # choose between english/multi

dream_bank = dreamy.get_HF_DreamBank(as_dataframe=True, language=language)
dream_bank = dream_bank.sample(n_samples).reset_index(drop=True)

dream_as_list = dream_sample["dreams"].tolist()

# set up model and  get encodings
model_size = "small"   # or large
model_lang = "english" # or multi, for multilingual
device     = "cpu"     # se to "cuda" for GPUs

report_encodings = dreamy.get_encodings(
    dream_as_list, 
    model_size=model_size,
    language=model_lang, 
    device=device,
)

# reduce space
# you can choose between pca/t-sne
X, Y = dreamy.reduce_space(report_encodings, method="pca") 

# Update your original dataframe with cohordinates and plot
dream_bank["DR_X"], dream_bank["DR_Y"] = X, Y
```
Then use your favourite visualisation library to explore the results.
```py

import seaborn as sns

sns.set_context("talk")
sns.set_style("whitegrid")

g = sns.scatterplot(
    data=dream_sample, 
    x="DR_X", 
    y="DR_Y", 
    hue="series",
    palette="Set2"
)
g.legend(loc='center left', title="DreamBank Series", bbox_to_anchor=(1, 0.5))

```
