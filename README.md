DReAMy is a python library built around pytorch and Hugging Face's ðŸ¤— [`transformers`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) to automatically analyse (for now) textual reports of dream. At the moment, annotations are based on the [Hall & Van de Castle](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4899-0298-6_2) emotions framewokr, but we are looking forward to expand our set applications.
